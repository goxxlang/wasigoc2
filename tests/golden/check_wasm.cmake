# Validates one wasigoc-generated .wasm module. Invoked via `cmake -P` from
# a ctest entry (see the wasigo_add_golden() function in CMakeLists.txt).
#
# Required: WASM_FILE
# Optional: WASMTIME (path to a wasmtime executable), and either
#   EXPECTED_OUTPUT (the program's expected stdout, with literal "\n"
#   standing in for a newline) or EXPECTED_OUTPUT_FILE (a fixture file
#   compared byte-for-byte, no escaping -- use this when the real output
#   itself contains literal backslash-n/t/" sequences, e.g. printed JSON,
#   which would collide with EXPECTED_OUTPUT's own substitution). If
#   WASMTIME and one of these is given, the module is actually run and its
#   output is checked; otherwise this just confirms a well-formed wasm
#   module was produced, since a wasm runtime may not be installed
#   everywhere this project is built.
