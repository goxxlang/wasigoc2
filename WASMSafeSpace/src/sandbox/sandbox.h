// This port's Sandbox: the actual "cage" -- real V8's Sandbox (src/sandbox/
// sandbox.h, vendored at third_party/v8/src/sandbox/sandbox.h) reserves a
// large (ideally ~1TB), alignment-fixed region of *virtual* address space
// via the OS, flanked by unmapped guard regions, and places most heap
// objects and all ArrayBuffer/WASM-memory backing stores inside it. The
// premise (real V8's own, stated in that file's doc comment): assume an
// attacker can, via a V8 memory-safety bug, corrupt memory anywhere inside
// the sandbox arbitrarily; the sandbox's job is to stop that corruption
// from reaching anything *outside* it.
//
// wasm32-wasip1 -- the actual target this whole repo exists for, see the
// top-level README -- has no OS virtual-memory reservation primitive to
// call (no mmap/VirtualAlloc with PROT_NONE guard pages): the module's
// entire linear memory already *is* a single flat, bounded 32-bit address
// space, and wasmtime's own sandboxing is what actually stops that linear
// memory from reaching anything outside the process -- a different,
// already-provided boundary, not this one. `Sandbox` here is a narrower,
// second boundary purely for defense-in-depth against a bug *inside* this
// port's own object model (the same threat real V8's Sandbox defends
// against): a single, real heap allocation acting as the cage, with real
// bounds tracking (`base()`/`end()`/`size()`/`Contains()`) and a real
// property that `sandboxed-pointer.h`'s compressed pointers are checked
// against. This port deliberately uses the *same* implementation on native
// builds too, rather than forking in real OS guard-page reservation behind
// a `#ifdef` for native only -- one real, portable mechanism, consistent
// with how CompressedPointer in ../WASMv8bindings/include/cppgc/internal/
// member-storage.h is a real (if degenerate) algorithm applied uniformly
// rather than gated by platform.
//
// What's real: the containment guarantee itself (`Contains()` is exact,
// not approximate), the base/end/size bookkeeping, and the single-active-
// sandbox `current()`/`set_current()` pattern real V8 uses per-thread (this
// port: per-process, single-threaded target, no thread_local needed -- same
// "exactly one live instance" simplification WASMv8bindings' cppgc::Heap
// already uses, see its heap.h file comment). What's cut: guard regions
// (nothing to reserve them from), the partially-reserved-sandbox fallback
// path, the real PageAllocator/VirtualAddressSpace abstraction layer (no
// OS pages to allocate), and multi-cage support
// (V8_COMPRESS_POINTERS_IN_MULTIPLE_CAGES) -- exactly one Sandbox at a
// time, like real V8's default (single-cage) configuration.
